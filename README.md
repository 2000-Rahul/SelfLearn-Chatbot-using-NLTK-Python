## Self Learning Chatbot using Python and NLTK
- A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet.
- A **self-learning chatbot**, also known as an AI or intelligent chatbot, is a type that uses machine learning algorithms to enhance its performance over time continuously. This indicates that the chatbot can acquire knowledge from user interactions and modify its responses accordingly.
- Why are chatbots important? <br>
 Organizations looking to increase sales or service productivity may adopt chatbots for time savings and efficiency, as artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can converse with users and answer recurring questions. <br>
 As consumers move away from traditional forms of communication, many experts expect chat-based communication methods to rise. Organizations increasingly use chatbot-based virtual assistants to handle simple tasks, allowing human agents to focus on other responsibilities.
## Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK)
- NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.
## Steps invovled in building chatbot
- **Importing libraries**
- **Reading text corpus**
- **Preprocessing (Stopwords, Removal, Lower case conversion etc)**
- **Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization**
- **Defining greeting functions**
- **Response Generation by the Bot using TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity**
- **Defining the Chat Flow**
- **Chatbot Conversation**
